How to run meld:

Open meld.
Create new comparison (top left, or in the menus)
-You'll be creating 3 comparisons:
	1. 2 column caesar
	2. 2 column quicksort
	3. 3 column caesar
For two columns, open \*fix.py on the left and \*master.py on the right.
For the 3 column, open \*blank/conflict/common.py in the middle, and the same as two columns for the left and right.
